A new CVE in the Linux kernel was released this week. CVE-2022-0847, aka “Dirty Pipe”, is a vulnerability that allows users on a Linux system to overwrite the contents of files that they can read but shouldn’t be able to write to. POC conducted in Attack-Defense-Lab. It is similar to CVE-2016-5195 “Dirty Cow” but is easier to exploit. To mitigate this issue, affected systems — those running Linux kernel 5.8 or above — should be patched immediately. However, the vulnerability was fixed in Linux 5.16.11, 5.15.25 and 5.10.102.
